 * Write a description of CountTo30 here.
 * 
 * Learning Goals
 * Understand how to apply while loops to a wider variety of patterns.  
 * 
 * Business Goal 
 * Print the numbers from 1 to 30 by using a while loop, 
 * and as few lines of code as possible.  
 * This is a quickie practice problem leading into upcoming concepts.  
 * 
 * Planning Your Code 
 * 1. Create one variable to hold the number that is counting up. 
 * 2. Write the code. 
 * 3. Run the code and work out the bugs. 
 * 4. See if you can find anywhere to shorten the code.
