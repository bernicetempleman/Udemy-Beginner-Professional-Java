# Udemy-Beginner-Professional-Java
Learn to Code for Work and Fun

Why am I taking this course?

I am currently a fulltime Master of Science CIS student at Florida Institute of Technology.
I decided to start preparing for fulltime professional work for Summer and/or Fall 2016 when I will be a part-time student taking online classes.

I am researching both internships and fulltime work.

One thing I found was a recommended course outline from LaunchCode:

I am taking this course because it is one of the recommended courses.
